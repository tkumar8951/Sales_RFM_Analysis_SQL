Sales_Analysis
Here, I explored a sales dataset and generated various analytics and insights from customers' past purchase behavior. I went from analyzing sales revenue to creating a customer segmentation analysis using the RFM technique. I went from basic SQL queries to exploring complex problems using SUB QUERY, CTEs, AGGREGATE, and WINDOW functions. I worked on the following skills in this project:

Importing a file into SQL Server Database
SQL Aggregate Functions
SQL Window Functions
SQL Sub Query
Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
SQL XML Path Function
Tableau
