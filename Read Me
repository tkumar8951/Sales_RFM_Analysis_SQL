# Sales_Analysis
Here, I explored a sales dataset and generated various analytics and insights from customers' past purchase behavior. I went from analyzing sales revenue to creating a customer segmentation analysis using the RFM technique. I went from basic SQL queries to exploring complex problems using SUB QUERY, CTEs, AGGREGATE, and WINDOW functions. I worked on the following skills in this project:
- Importing a file into SQL Server Database
- SQL Aggregate Functions
- SQL Window Functions
- SQL Sub Query
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- SQL XML Path Function
- Tableau
